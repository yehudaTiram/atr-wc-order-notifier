# Creating and Using a Telegram Bot: A Non-Technical Guide

## Step 1: Set Up Your Bot

1. Open Telegram and search for "BotFather"
2. Start a chat with BotFather and type <span style="color:#1b75d0"><ins>/newbot</ins></span>
3. Follow the prompts to name your bot and choose a username
4. BotFather will provide you with a bot token - save this securely

## Step 2: Configure Your Bot

1. Set a profile picture for your bot (optional)
2. Add a description of what your bot does
3. Set up commands your bot can respond to (if applicable)
   
#### <span style="color:red">IMPORTANT!</span> You MUST first send a message (anything) to the bot before the bot can send messages to you.

## Step 3: Get Your Chat ID

1. Start a conversation with your new bot
2. Send a message to your bot
3. Open a web browser and enter:
   ```
   https://api.telegram.org/bot<YourBotToken>/getUpdates
   ```
   (Replace <YourBotToken> with your actual bot token)
4. Look for the "id" field in the "chat" section of the response
5. This number is your chat ID

## Step 4: Add Bot to the Plugin Settings
1. Go to the plugin's settings in admin menu WooCommerce -> ATR WC Order Notifier
### General tab
1. In <ins>**Bot Token**</ins> enter the bot token you received from BotFather
2. In <ins>**Chat ID**</ins> enter the chat ID you found in Step 3
3. Check <ins>**Enable Telegram**</ins> option
4. In the <ins>**Select statuses**</ins> check Woocommerce statuses you want to be notified on
5. Save the settings. From now on every order status change you selected will send a message to your Telegram bot in your telegram account.
### Message details tab
Check the details you want to see in the notifications


## More info about the encrypting of your Telegram Bot Token

To enhance the security of your Telegram bot token in the plugin settings, we use an encryption process. Here's what you need to know:
1. **Bot Token Encryption**: Once you enter the bot token and set all your preferences and save the settings, the plugin will automatically encrypt your Telegram bot token.
2. **Security Benefits**:
   - The encrypted token is stored instead of the plain text version
   - Even if someone gains access to your database, they can't use the token
   - Adds an extra layer of protection for your bot's security

By using this encryption method, you significantly reduce the risk of your Telegram bot token being compromised, even if there's unauthorized access to your plugin settings or database[1].
